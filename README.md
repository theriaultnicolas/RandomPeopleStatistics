# RandomPeopleStatistics

The goal of this test is to create an python API **client** for the following user api: https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users

- Retrieve 10 users from the API and output them (as long as we can see the output somewhere).
- Return statistics on the users. 
  - Give the average age of the 10 users (the users have a date_of_birth property). 
  - Return the top 5 oldest users and the top 5 youngest users.
- (Bonus) Add an option to your client to use a caching system instead of calling the API directly.
- (Bonus) Add unit tests to your client.

Please use the `typing` module for variables, function and method definitions.

At this point, if your plan is to create a REST API **server**, please reconsider and return reading the first line of this readme.
